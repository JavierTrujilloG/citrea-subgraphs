# Instant Subgraphs

[Goldsky's Instant Subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/guides/create-a-no-code-subgraph)

Simple JSON config file to index a contract with an ABI.

Here we grab the ABI from [Morph Holesky block explorer](https://explorer.devnet.citrea.xyz/token/0x11f6e6718F748eD9693b2AA5293a33951C51b1BA).

All ERC-20 contracts should use a common ABI. Same is true for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (though they differ from each other).
