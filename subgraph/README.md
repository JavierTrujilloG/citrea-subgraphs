# Subgraph 101

## Deploying ERC-20 subgraph to Goldsky

We'll be indexing [Citrea USDT token contract](https://explorer.devnet.citrea.xyz/token/0x11f6e6718F748eD9693b2AA5293a33951C51b1BA) on Citrea Devnet.

The subgraph is already build, all you need to do is to deploy it onto Goldsky with the following command:
`goldsky subgraph deploy usdt-citrea-balances/1.0.0`

Alternatively, you can easily use this subgraph code to index any other ERC-20 contract by changing in the `subgraph.yaml`:
- Contract Address
- Start Block

Run `graph codegen` and `graph build` before deploying the subgraph.

All of the code for this example was borrowed from [Chainstack](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/subgraphs-tutorial-indexing-erc-20-token-balance).
